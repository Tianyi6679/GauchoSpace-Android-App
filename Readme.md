# GauchoSpace-Android-App

## Motivation
GauchoSpace is the information hub of the UCSB coursework, and students could access all their course resources(reading materials, handouts, homework descriptions, etc) in one place by using GauchoSpace. For now GauchoSpace only has its web portal and if a student is on a move and want to check if there’s any update of his/her course, he/she must use the browser on his/her phone. Why don’t we develop an app for them?

## Project content:
An Android app that provides [GauchoSpace](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/) information for the UCSB students. Here are the main features of this app:
* The users can use this app to login their own accounts for GauchoSpace and obtain course information, such as homework assignments, deadlines, and grades. 
* This app will unify all the deadlines from the courses that are currently enrolled by the user.
* This app will push notification for the user if there’s any update has been made for the course resources.
* Some of the instructors do not use GauchoSpace so this app would allow users add these individual course pages to the app as a form of hyperlink.
